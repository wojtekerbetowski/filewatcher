Add a module `hasher` with a function with a signature 

```def hash_content(path: Path) -> str```

which returns a SHA1 hash of the contents of a given file.

Steps:

* [ ] Add a module with the function signature 
* [ ] Write unit tests to cover the requirements
* [ ] Implement the function and make sure all tests pass
* [ ] (Optional) Create unit tests mocking the file system (for speed and independence)
