Add a module `traverser` with a function with a signature 

```def list_files(directory: pathlib.Path) -> Iterator[pathlib.Path]```

which returns all regular files, from a given directory, recursively (without directories, links).

Steps:

* [ ] Add a module with the function signature 
* [ ] Write unit tests to cover the requirements
* [ ] Implement the function and make sure all tests pass
